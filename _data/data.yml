          level: <small> At the point where the job market peaked, and ML OPS was all the rage and everyone hiring like crazy, Rahul applied to Elsevier. A couple of interviews later, I was wholly convinced that here is a Guy Who Knows - and Rahul has demonstrated this every day at work. Rahul is the definition of an ML OPS expert. There is no Machine Learning model that he will not deploy fast, efficient, subject to optimization and criticism, and ends up being that reliable corner stone of your operations. Rahul is diligent, putting in the hours for things that need doing. On top of that, he spends considerable time educating himself about what could be done, and should be done further down the line. This makes Rahul a very reliable conversation partner for all tactical and strategic choices, and an absolute top expert in the field. Contributing to the community, talking and presenting at meetups, Rahul does it all. Ah, yeah, and also, just a very nice person, easy to get along with. Hugely enjoyed working with him. </small>

          level: <small> I rarely come across real talents who stand out like Raahul. I had the pleasure of working with Raahul in multiple projects, assignments and patents. Raahul has a unique blend on innovative mindset and sharp focus on solving business problems. He is a person one would love to keep in the team for his ability to quickly slice and dice the problem without much fuss and getting value out quickly. Always happy to have him on my team again to build great solutions. </small>

          level: <small> Raahul worked on my team, as an Advanced Research and Prototyping engineer, for about 2 years. His primary role had been on our "Research Labs" function (innovation, product incubation) but he has also contributed to the base product development (in web development area). Overall, I will rate him as a very quick learner, who takes initiative, is never afraid to learn new things and has a great attitude towards getting things done. In terms of his contributions, he has worked on prototypes related to Beacons (ranging, monitoring, navigation), facial recognition, sentiment analysis, machine learning and chat bot. He was a co-inventor on 2 patent applications related to the usage of Beacons in enterprise applications. It was a pleasure working with Raahul. All the best to him for his future endeavors!! </small>

          level: <small> Raahul has been an energetic data scientist, fast learner and with a constant endeavour to innovate in my team in Optum. His command on machine learning and attitude to solve atypical business problems delivers high business value fast. Always happy to have him on my team again.</small>
